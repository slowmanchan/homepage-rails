#Homepage Rails

This is my personal homepage made using ruby on rails and styled with css.  I have also added a custom made blog also made with rails that allows posts by the admin and comments by signed up users.  

Authentication is handeled by the Devise gem.

There are a few jquery plugins used as well including slick carousel for the image carousel.

Thanks for visiting.
